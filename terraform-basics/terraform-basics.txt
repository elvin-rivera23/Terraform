Terraform Variable Types:
- String
  - varaible "a-string"{
    type = string
  }
- Number
  - variable "this-is-a-number" {
    type=number
  }
- Bool
  - variable "true-or-false" {
    type = bool
  }


Terraform complex types:
- List(type)
  - [0,1,5,2]
- Set(type)
    - like a list, but it doesn't keep the order you put it in, and can only conatin unqiue values
    - a list that has [5, 1, 1, 2] becomes [1, 2, 5] in a set (when you output it, terraform will sort it)
- Map(type)
  - {"key" = "value"}
- Object({<ATTR NAME> = <TYPE>, ...})
  - map but each element can have a diff type. (think dictionary in python)
- Tubple([<TYPE>, ...])
  - a tuple is a list, but each element can have a diff type. immutable

NOTE: terraform can decide on the type
